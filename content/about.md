# About Me

Hey there! I'm Grace, a developer and designer who loves building things that make a difference.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about creating tools and experiences that make learning and productivity more accessible. Whether it's an AI-powered study platform, a disaster relief coordination tool, or a robotics scouting system, I love combining clean code with thoughtful UX to solve real problems.

## My Journey

I started coding in high school after joining my school's FIRST Robotics team as the programming lead. That experience taught me not just how to write code, but how to build systems that work reliably under pressure and how to collaborate with a diverse team toward a shared goal.

Since then, I've built 7+ full-stack applications serving over 10,000 users, led product design for award-winning DECA projects, and contributed to research in nano-grinding optimization.

## What Drives Me

I believe technology should be empowering, not overwhelming. Every project I work on starts with understanding the people who'll use it - their needs, their constraints, and their goals. From there, it's about finding the elegant solution that makes their lives easier.

## Outside of Code

When I'm not building things, you can find me:
- Competing in DECA business competitions
- Mentoring younger students in robotics and coding
- Experimenting with new design tools and frameworks
- Reading about HCI, product design, and system architecture

## Let's Build Something

I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that have a meaningful impact. Whether you have an idea, a problem to solve, or just want to chat about tech and design, feel free to reach out!
